# Qatar Museums Digital Assets Management Import Tool

This tool was created for Qatar Museums (QM) during my internship at their Digital Assets department. It was created to streamline the use of the newly commissioned Digital Asset Management (DAM) solution. Before this tool, QM staff had to manually perform tasks such as copying terabytes of files from the QM server into the DAM staging area, manually filling in the AMP manifest file with source and destination file paths, security policies, filetype models etc. 

Furthermore, sharing these files involved the tedious and expensive use of commerical file transfer services. They also need to be trained to perform a lot of these tasks, wasting precious company time. However, the creation of this tool has alleviated almost all of these issues. It is now widely adopted by QM staff and allows them to automate many tasks such as:

- Generating AMP manifest files for import into the QM DAM system following standard templates.
- Automating the process of copying files from QM servers to the DAM AMP staging area.
- Validating the folder structure in directories and alerting the user to any discrepancies.
- Setting security policies and mappings from asset type to DAM model. 
- Emailing specified stakeholders with logs of the completed tasks and any associated files, avoiding the use of expensive file transfer services.
- Checking any prerequisites for the tasks and alerting users if they haven't been fulfilled.

All of this functionality is accompanied by a clean, easy to navigate GUI.
